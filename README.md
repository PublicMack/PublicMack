# Hi there, I'm PublicMack!

**Software developer** focused on building clean, functional tools with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. 

I use this to teach code about code and presence.

-  I’m currently working on: A lot of stuff.
-  Great at: Front-end and back-end development
-  Open to: Research, collaborations & remote projects
-  Fun fact: I’m ALWAYS quietly building something cool behind the scenes
